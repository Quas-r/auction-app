# Auction App
## This is an auction application implemented in Python.

The app uses PyQt5 and Python sockets to implement an auction system.
It is not that complex of an application, however, it showcases some
fundamental methods that can be used to create such a system.

In order to run the app, first run
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 
in the project directory in order to install required packages.
(which as of yet is only PyQt5)

After that, start a server by running `auction_server.py` and
run your client by running `auction_client.py`.
